/**
 * <p>Image decoder.</p>
 *
 * <p>Decoders are instantiated per request and need not be thread-safe. But
 * any library they call into <em>does</em> need to support simultaneous usage
 * from multiple threads.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Notes</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Initialization and disposal</h3>
 *
 * <p>Instances should not use constructors to initialize themselves. Instead
 * they may implement {@link Plugin#initializePlugin()}, or they may defer
 * initialization until first use.</p>
 *
 * <p>Likewise, for class-level initialization, implementations should use
 * {@link Plugin#onApplicationStart()} instead of a static initializer.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances should release all necessary resources using {@link
 * #close}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Image indexes</h3>
 *
 * <p>Several methods accept an {@code imageIndex} argument, which is meant to
 * enable access to multiple images contained within the same file, as in the
 * case of e.g. a client "page" query. How this works is:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>For basic still images, there is only the main image at index {@code
 *     0}.</li>
 *     <li>For formats like JPEG2000 that support different resolution levels
 *     of the same image, there is still only the main image at index {@code
 *     0}.</li>
 *     <li>For formats like TIFF and PDF that support multiple sibling images
 *     or pages, these are accessible by their index. Some special
 *     considerations for TIFF:
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>TIFF also supports subimages of subimages, which this
 *             interface does not.)</li>
 *             <li>The sibling images in a TIFF may be different resolution
 *             levels, as in a pyramidal TIFF. In this case, they will
 *             <em>not</em> be accessible by their index.</li>
 *         </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>For formats like HEIF that support <em>unordered</em> subimages,
 *     each subimage will have an unpredictable index assigned by the codec
 *     library. (The primary image will generally be at index 0.)</li>
 *     <li>For animated image formats like GIF, each frame has its own
 *     index.</li>
 *     <li>For video formats, the index refers to each second of the
 *     video.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The value passed to an {@code imageIndex} argument must never be greater
 * than the return value of {@code {@link #getNumImages()} - 1}&mdash;otherwise
 * an {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException} is thrown.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Default implementations</h3>
 *
 * <p>Some methods have default implementations. These correspond with features
 * that may be nice to have in some circumstances but are nevertheless
 * nonessential.</p>

 * <p>A scale-constrained image can be thought of as a virtually downscaled
 * source image. In contrast to a {@link Scale}, the dimensions of a
 * scale-constrained image appear (to the client) to be the dimensions
 * resulting from the constraint, so any scaling-related operations expressed
 * by the client are relative to the scale-constrained image.</p>
 *
 * <p>Scale constraints are used for providing access to limited-resolution
 * versions of images depending on authorization status. An unauthorized client
 * may only be able to access a 1/2 scaled image, for example.</p>
 *
 * <p>Scale constraints are expressed as fractions, mainly in order to avoid
 * repeating decimals, which would make for URIs that are hard to
 * canonicalize.</p>

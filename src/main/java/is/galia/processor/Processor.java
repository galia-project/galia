     *     than the ones in the list, as this could cause problems with
     *     caching.</li>
     *     <li>{@link Operation}s should be applied in the order they are
     *     iterated.</li>
     *     <li>In addition to operations, the {@link OperationList} may contain
     *     {@link OperationList#getOptions() options}, which implementations
     *     should respect, where applicable. Option values may originate from
     *     the {@link Configuration#forApplication() application configuration},
     *     so implementations should not try to read the application
     *     configuration themselves, as this could also cause problems with
     *     caching.</li>
     *     <li>The arguments should be assumed to all be valid. The provided
     *     {@link OutputStream} is likely going to write to the response, so it
     *     is already too late to e.g. render an error page.</li>
     * </ul>

     * @param opList       Operation list to process, which has already been
     *                     {@link OperationList#validate(Size, Format)
     *                     validated}.
     * @param outputStream Stream to write the image to, which should not be

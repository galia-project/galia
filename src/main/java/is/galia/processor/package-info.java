/**
 * <p>Package in which processors reside.</p>
 *
 * <p>A processor is an image processing library. Given a reference to a
 * source image, it does the following:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Acquires the image from a {@link is.galia.codec.Decoder}</li>
 *     <li>Applies the {@link is.galia.operation.Operation operations} from an
 *     {@link is.galia.operation.OperationList} in order</li>
 *     <li>Writes the result to an {@link java.io.OutputStream} provided by an
 *     {@link is.galia.codec.Encoder}. In this way it is source- and output-
 *     agnostic&mdash;it doesn't care where the source image is coming from,
 *     where the processed variant image is going to, or even what format
 *     either of them are in, necessarily.</li>
 * </ol>
